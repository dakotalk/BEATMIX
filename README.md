# BEATMIX 

## Remixes Beatles songs with the Echo Nest Remix API. 
## Written at Spotify during the Synthesis and Samples hackathon on 3/28/15.

BEATMIX takes songs as input, gets estimated chroma vectors for each beat, generates a chord progression via Markov chain, synthesizes a corresponding bassline, then rearranges beats of the song judged to have pitch content closest to the desired chord roots in the progression. 

The final result uses slices of the original song as an instrument, so to speak, reducing the musical acumen of the Beatles to little more than a deliciously glitchy sprinkling of pitch croutons over trite four-chord progressions.
